		<p>Meghan Ventura is an <strong>editor</strong> and <strong>writer</strong> who is learning <strong>web development</strong> at New York Code + Design Academy. She adores and tries to promote the NYC games scene, has played <strong>video games</strong> her whole life and is always looking for something new.</p>

		<p>She lives in the city's hipster epicenter, where she reads, cooks weird vegetables (romanesco, a favorite), sometimes practices yoga (but is usually on a gym elliptical), and occasionally studies Japanese. </p>

		<p>She tried really hard to make this website pretty, but that's why she'll probably take NYCDA's UX/UI class in a few weeks!</p>
